# How to
Assortment of "How to xxx" I want to remember.


## Fast GPIO writes on an ESP32
Set or clear ESP32 GPIO pins via direct register access; an example [sketch](esp32-fast-gpio/esp32-fast-gpio.md).
This is much faster than via the Arduino API.


## SNR
Computing the signal to noise ratio [SNR](snr/snr.md) of a series of measurements.
