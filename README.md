Assortment of "How to xxx" I want to remember.


## Fast GPIO writes on an ESP32
Set or clear ESP32 GPIO pins via direct register access; this is much faster than via the Arduino API.
For an example and explanation see [esp32-fast-gpio](esp32-fast-gpio/esp32-fast-gpio.md).


## Open drain on an ESP32
Unlike traditional Arduino boards, the ESP32 allows configuring its GPIO pins as open drain. 
For an example and explanation see [esp32-opendrain](esp32-opendrain/esp32-opendrain.md).


## SNR
Computing the signal to noise ratio [SNR](snr/snr.md) of a series of measurements.


## Open drain on an ESP32
The Serial Plotter in Arduino 2.0 has a too narrow x-axis. That can be patched wider.
For an example and explanation see [arduino2.0-wideplot](arduino2.0-wideplot/arduino2.0-wideplot.md).
